Linode DynDNS Updater
By Jed Smith <jed@jedsmith.org>
Updated by Mike Swanson <rearden@atlantisvalley.com>

For customers of Linode that use the Linode DNS manager.  
Released into the public domain.

Requires Python 3.0 or above.  Python 2.6 may work.
Contains directions in the script (which you'll have to edit anyway).

Mike Swanson:

Some changes needed to be made to the original script due to what I 
assume were changes to Linode's API structure.  Comments on specific 
changes are in script file.
